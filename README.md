# promo-io.git
Build a project using polymorphic table that allows client and artist to interact through a common interface.

This project aims to build a way for artists and client to have two way communications. Instead of to do lists to solve business problems. The resolution is sort of like copyright approval. Instead of the designer haviong a lot of back an forth, the client uploads an image for background for instance, and adds a description of what he wants, etc. could add multiple images, text fields, etc. The artist will then send to the client his rendering of the clients ideas and will get as thumbs upo or thumbs down. Thei will be campaiagn driven, with the artist user able to always be in contact with the client user throiugh the same interface. The artist and diguss the ad with the client and will get a thumbs up or thuymbs down to proceed or not.

This will use polymorphic featurres to post images, pages, users, descriptions, etc. This will be achieved through tables that cana be applied to many other tables through a method known as table inheritence.
